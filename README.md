This repository demonstrates an uncommon Kotlin code error related to using the `map()` function with nullable lists. The issue arises when a nullable list is passed to the `map()` function. While the safe-call operator (`?.`) prevents a `NullPointerException`, the result of the operation is `null`, which might be unexpected and lead to runtime errors if not handled correctly.  The solution provides a way to handle this situation gracefully using the elvis operator or the `orEmpty()` function.
